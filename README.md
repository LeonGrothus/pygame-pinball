# Pinball Game

Welcome to our Pinball game, a modern take on the classic arcade game. The game begins with 5 balls. Players can launch a ball into the playfield by pressing the space bar. The objective is to accumulate as many points as possible. Achieving a score of 5000 points will release the next ball. Subsequent goals are set at 10000 points, 20000 points, and so on. The game only saves the highest score achieved by a player. To prevent cheating, our scoreboard and savegame data are stored as images.
